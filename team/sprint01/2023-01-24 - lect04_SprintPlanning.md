# Notes:

- We refreshed on each team members' strengths and areas to work on
- Also delegated leader for first retrospective on Friday
- Following this, we made a learning plan for weeks 3 and 4 for team members to do some learning in order to gain understanding of the different parts of a webapp
- We discussed what our kanban board should look like: a hierarchy of User Stories with associated issues
- For the MVP, we planned for allowing users to log in and view and upload to their their feed as well as their profile page, and navigate between these screens (notably leaving saving recipes for a later time)
- We discussed that for lab02, since we only needed to have issues assigned, we would have updated the Kanban board for the features needed in the MVP as well as for later development
