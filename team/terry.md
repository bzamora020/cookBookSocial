Hi, I am Terry. I'm a fourth year CS student, and I'm very excited for this class! My strengths are primarily in web development, but my previous experience in CS156 (app development class) should help here as well.

My ideas for this project are to introduce good ways to filtering and finding different types of view that promotes user exploration and allows user to discover things they didn't know existed.
