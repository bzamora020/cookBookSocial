## Retro Assessment

Terry Pi

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.

I used the start/stop/continue retro outline, as I learned in CS 156, as I think it helps faciliate participation.

* A brief assessment of how it went.

I think it went well. Everyone continuted to at least one point, and we had something to work on that have actionable steps.

* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?
  
Keep things moving and reiterate things people have said.
