# Retro 2
Date of Retrospective: 02/17/23

* Led by: Gita Supramaniam
* Present: Nicolas, Terry, Jacob, Daoyi, Will, Bryan
* Absent: N/A

## Action item

Start/Goal:
- Refactor code to have functions in other files (vs all in one file)
- Think about features for final product
  - friends + messaging
  - likes/saving (tabs/groups by category), similar to homepage
  - make lists and share (similar to Pinterest or rateyourmusic.com)
  - load certain amount of posts at a time (like infinite scrolling)
  - commenting on posts for social aspect
  - reset password/profile improvements
- Open issues for bugs + fix

Stop/Change:
- getting stuck on one particular issue, we can try to communicate when stuck or try pair programming (also good for coming up with more ideas!)

Continue:
- Good communication (Slack and otherwise), posting consistent updates and feedback
- Adding issues to the kanban board as we come up with them
- Making consistent progress on issues (got a lot done for MVP)

Measurement of Change:
- Consistently having all team members making progress on issues in kanban board
- Communication in Slack about difficulties with issues as they arise

## Retro Assessment

* Retro Process Used: Start/Stop/Continue via a Google Jamboard because it is simple to understand and encourages participation with guided topics.
* Brief Assessment of Retro: I think it went well because there was a lot of discussion across different topics (team goals, team collaboration) and everyone got to contribute. There were also action items that arose from discussion.
* Advice For Next Retro: Balance suggesting directions for discussion with allowing pauses for participants to do the same.
