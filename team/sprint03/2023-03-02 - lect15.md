# Notes:

## For lab tomorrow
- TERRY: an overview system architecture diagram and associated explanation.
- GITA AND JACOB: a Section summarizing important team decisions since the start of the project, referring to meetings logged in your GitHub repo
- BRYAN the beginnings of a Section talking about your User Experience (UX) considerations. A high-level task/user flow (see below) might be the first thing to document there, and it will also be helpful for determining the structure of your manual (next weekâ€™s lab).

## Updates

- Bryan finished the frontend functionality for replying to recipes, working on backend
- Will finished the likes features and will start on working on searching for users
- Jacob added loading wheels to the home screen as well as the recipe adding modal, he also added so that the page location saved when adding new recipes, and when directed to a broken profile, it will lead to an error page
- Gita will continue working on displaying only 10 posts at a time
- Nic finished the cancel friend request, and is working on the PR for it.
